# crud-book-mobile-app-flutter

This project contains a mobile aggregation application specifically for managing read books. It allows adding book entries to its database, opening them in a separate menu and modifying their entries in the application display. The application has a Material user interface, and it is written in Dart, using the Flutter open source framework.

This iteration of the project is similar to the one made in Kotlin, but it has been entirely remade using Flutter, for cross-platform support.
